# Smart To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple smart to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The application utilizes localStorage to store tasks, ensuring persistence across page reloads and browser closures.

## Features

- Add tasks by typing them into the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Delete tasks by clicking on the "x" icon next to them.
- Task completion status and list items are saved in localStorage.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the input box to add tasks and the buttons/icons to manage tasks.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file defining the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for the application.
- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file providing functionality for adding, marking, and deleting tasks, as well as saving and displaying tasks using localStorage.
- `images/`: Directory containing images used in the application.
